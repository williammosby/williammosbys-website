            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am a senior at boonville high school. Just a few years ago I heard about about computer science/software develoment that is when I knew this is what I wanted to do. So I signed up for <a href="https://sictc.evscschools.com/">sictc</a> I did't get in my junior year but my senior year I was accepted. Coming into this year I had little to no experience with coding. But i tried my hardest to learn and understand every concept. all though I dont understand them all perfectly I understand most of them a little bit its all just gonna be practice and continuing to learn. But I am definetly more confident in my coding abilites now.</p>
